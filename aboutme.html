      <h1>WHY I STARTED WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
    </strong>
    <hr size="3" noshade>
  </center>
  <p>I finished school in the year 2017 for some time everything was going well or so I tought, little did i know that although things seemed fine then i was lacking one thing that was very very essential and will eventually come to bite me back in
    the ass and that was a <strong>GOAL</strong></p>
  <p><strong>GOAL</strong> what is a goal, A goal 2 me at that time was a destination or probably a focus. I at that time was everywhere but yet nowhere it might sound strange to u but the me now figured out that I was extremely busy but yet idle
    <em><strong>crazy right</strong></em>
  </p>
  <p>Anyway let not loose sight of the matter at hand <em>back to the main topic</em> and bla bla bla bla crazy shit happened, I lost everything went back to square 1 extremely broke and didn't know where to pick myself up from or what to even do
    about school, I just kept on moving and drifting away from the right path and drowning myself by reading mangas all day long. </p>
  <p>fotunately i was <strong><em>extremely</em></strong> lucky that i had people around me who wouldn't give up on me and kept pushing me telling me that i can do better, and i can be better I just needed to find a focus, pick mysely up and get back
    on track and the most <strong>amazing</strong> part was that not only did he advice me but he also helped lift me up and showed me a new starting point.</p>
  <center>
    <strong>
      <h2>The New Beginning</h2>
    </strong>
  </center>
  <ul>
    <li>Education Resumption</li>
    <li>Strive</li>
    <li>Patience</li>
    <li>Focus</li>
    <li>Resources</li>
    <li>Finance</li>
    <li>Data</li>
    <li>Electricity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This were all the factor to be consider to get my lift back on track, It wasn't easy to get my shit together by I wouldn't say it was hard either considering the trill I felt knowing that i am finally getting my life back together.</p>
  <strong>
    <h2>The Advice</h2>
  </strong>
  <p>All thanks to those who truly had me at heart &#10084 i was given two advice and they are as followed</p>
  <ol>
    <strong>
      <li>Get Back To School</li>
    </strong>
    <p>I was adviced to go back to school, but well as u might have guessed there were many problems.</p>
    <h4>problems</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Expired GCE</li>
      <li>No jamb</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So as a solution to this my only option was to consider Online schooling and that was how i found out about <a href="https://nou.edu.ng/">Noun</a>, noun is an online school that you can easily register into as long as you have a really good
      GCE result.</p>
    <strong>
      <li>Learning Web Development</li>
    </strong>
    <p>Presently this is the first and only html i've written although I think just by looking at it, it's pretty obvious but anyway I will let u be the judge of that &#128521. And that was pretty much how I started web development.</p>
